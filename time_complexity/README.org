* Time complexity 

** Data sources
- *dataset_for_timer.R*
  - We choose the real data in the mouse immune cells experiment 
    (See TM_anlaysis/data_preprocessing.R for details). 
  - Then partition the dataset based on difference cell numbers with this script

** How to run
*** Jobs under make
- Our jobs are organized and executed by *make* under the *jobs* directory.
- Our jobs are submitted into the *slurm* to run. But you can get it run locally
  by following the shell scripts under *jobs*. 
*** SIMPLEs
- *simple_timer.R* is used to get the time cost for SIMPLEs.
- *others_timer.R* is used to get the time cost for other methods.

** Result Summary
- *simple_timer_summary.R* 
  - generate the left two figures in Supplementary Text: Figure S21.
- *timer_compare_summary.R*
  - generate the right figure in Supplementary Text: Figure S21.
